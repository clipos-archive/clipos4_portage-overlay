gpg: Sanitize diagnostic with the original file name.

* g10/mainproc.c (proc_plaintext): Sanitize verbose output.
--

This fixes a forgotten sanitation of user supplied data in a verbose
mode diagnostic.  The mention CVE is about using this to inject
status-fd lines into the stderr output.  Other harm good as well be
done.  Note that GPGME based applications are not affected because
GPGME does not fold status output into stderr.

CVE-id: CVE-2018-12020
GnuPG-bug-id: 4012

CLIP: Adapted for 2.0.28.
